# Credit_Card_churn
We need to come up with a classification model that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards

We need to identify the best possible model that will give the required performance.
Implement EDA, univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis

Try different classifier method and check which one give best results.

Result - here best model is gradient boost because in another Random Forest model train accuracy is 100% which is sign of over fitting
